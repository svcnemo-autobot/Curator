"""Stage-adapter contract for audio speech-recognition.

Mirrors the diarization/LID/VAD contract: ``ASRStage`` owns Curator-side glue
(``task.data`` reads, batching, ISO language mapping, ``_skip_me``),
while ``ASRAdapter`` (this module) owns the model-side call (prefetch, setup,
generation, packing into ``ASRResult``). The split lets the stage swap models
via a single YAML ``adapter_target:`` line.

class ASRResult:
    """Canonical per-utterance ASR adapter output.

    Identical across every adapter so the stage's schema-mutation path stays
    constant when the adapter is swapped.

    Attributes:
        text: Primary transcription (Turn-1 / sole output). Empty if skipped.
        secondary_text: Optional Turn-2 / disfluency-preserved output;
            ``None`` for single-turn or skipped Turn-2. Written to
            ``task.data`` only when ``ASRStage.disfluency_text_key`` is set.
        skipped: True when the item could not be processed (e.g. empty/corrupt
            waveform); the stage then sets ``skip_me_key = "empty_audio"``.
        skip_reason: Optional machine-readable reason written to ``skip_me_key``
            when ``skipped`` is true. Defaults to ``"empty_audio"`` in the stage.
        unsupported_language: Optional normalized language code used by the
            stage to annotate items excluded by its language allowlist.
        extras: Adapter-specific diagnostics outside the canonical shape; the
            stage never reads inside this dict.

    Constructor contract: the stage builds adapters as
    ``cls(model_id=..., revision=..., **adapter_kwargs)``, so every adapter
    must accept ``model_id`` and ``revision`` keyword args plus its own knobs.

    Per-batch contract: ``transcribe_batch`` receives a list of per-task dicts
    (unpacked from ``task.data``) and returns one ``ASRResult`` per input, in
    order. Expected per-item keys (stage-populated):

    * ``waveform``: canonical Curator waveform object from the stage
      (typically a torch tensor shaped ``(channels, samples)``); adapters own
      any model-specific conversion such as squeezing to 1-D numpy.
    * ``sample_rate`` (``int``): source rate; adapter handles any resampling.
    * ``language`` (``str | None``): human-readable name (e.g. ``"English"``).
    * ``language_code`` (``str | None``): original language code from the
      configured stage input column.
    * ``reference_text`` (``str | None``): optional transcript/reference text
      from ``ASRStage.reference_text_key`` for adapters or prompts that need
      row-level text context.
    * ``task_id`` (``str | None``): carried through for diagnostics.
